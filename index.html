            <h2>Python</h2>
            <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
                readability with the use of significant indentation.
                Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
                It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>

            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript <br>(/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/)</br> often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
                technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript
                on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries.
                All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
                JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
                It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
                supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
                interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
                and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

            <h2>C++</h2>
            <p>C++ <br>(/ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/, pronounced "C plus plus" and sometimes abbreviated as CPP)</br>
                is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist
                Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since
                expanded significantly over time; as of 1997 C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features,
                in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented
                as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation,
                LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.[14]</p>
